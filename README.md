Zork Remastered

## What made the early Infocom games like Zork so special?

- Even though computers did not have good graphics, they enabled talented storytellers to paint vivid pictures in your mind, using *words*, not *graphics*, much like books vs. movies today.
- Even though computers did not have a lot of speed or memory, talented software engineers were able to create a powerful game engine and language parser, with a rich vocabulary and grammar, which enabled you to interact with the story in a wide variety of ways.

## Appendix: Possible improvements

### Graphics vs Text

- If we replaced the written dialogue with graphics (output), with graphics written dialogue with graphics, it would take away your imagination, and take away the story-writing talent of the original authors.
- If we replaced the TO DO input text
